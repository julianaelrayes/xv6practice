head_kernel.c: this code acts as a simple interface to a "head" functionality, allowing the user to specify the number of lines to display and the source (either standard input or a file) via command-line arguments. It prints the specified number of lines and exits. This file calls the functions from the sysproc.c file. No help needed.

head_user.c: The provided code is a simplified implementation of the 'head' command in xv6. It allows users to display the first few lines of specified text files or standard input. The main function processes command-line arguments, checks for the number of lines to display, and then reads and displays the specified lines from the input sources, either files or standard input. The head function handles the reading and display of lines from a file descriptor. Help from Fhaheem to implement fiole descriptor to display first lines. 

syscall.c,syscall.h, sysproc.c, usys.S, user.h: briefly modified guiding myself from website: https://medium.com/@mahi12/adding-system-call-in-xv6-a5468ce1b463 obtained from TA (Manas)

uniq_kernel.c and uniq_user.c:  simplified implementation of the 'uniq' command. It allows users to process and manipulate text input, primarily for removing duplicate lines or displaying the count of repeated lines. When executed, the code first prints a message indicating that it's operating in kernel mode. Then, it examines the command-line arguments to determine the desired operation. If no arguments are provided, it calls the uniq_kernel function with "stdin" as the input source and "z" as the option, which effectively removes consecutive duplicate lines from standard input. If a single argument is given, it's treated as input, and the "-n" option is added when invoking uniq_kernel. In the case of two arguments, the first one is expected to be a valid option (-c, -i, or -d), and the second one is the input source. If the provided option is valid, it calls uniq_kernel with the input and the chosen option. However, if an invalid option is provided, it displays an error message suggesting the use of valid alternatives like '-c', '-i', or '-d'. Help from Hitesh of how to implement the flags from the terminal  

sysproc.c: files that kernel functions use. Help from this website: https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/os/previous_years/2011/xv6_html/syscall_8c.html#662eedd65f3e2165093842b80e3bc024 to see how to pass arguments or data from the user program to the system call. from TA (Manas)
